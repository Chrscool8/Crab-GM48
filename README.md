A game we made [live on stream](http://twitch.tv/chrisbradel) in 48 hours for the [GM48 game jam](https://gm48.net/)!

[It won 4th place](https://gm48.net/results/39/island)!

(Expect rushed, sleepless code!)

About:
- 4 Letter Talismans to be found and brought to the CRAB altar.
- 4 Upgrades to be found to increase your ability to navigate.
- 5 Original Songs.
- Procedurally generated landscape and decorations for a different experience every playthrough.
- Room wrapping in all directions for endless sailing.
- I livestreamed almost 45 hours of the development time! (I'm very tired.) You can find the VODs and lots of other fun videos on my Twitch, ChrisBradel.
- Disclaimer! This is a heavy game to run at max settings with all the shaders active, but you can toggle them individually or as a whole with a couple button presses (see below) to pick which effects you find most important to see.
